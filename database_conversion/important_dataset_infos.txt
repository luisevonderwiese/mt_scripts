Datasets not converted to binary alignments:
- Datasets in cldf without forms.csv + cogantes.csv and without values.csv
- beidazihui und wanghmongmien: cognates.csv is empty

CLLD:
- Apics: values.csv exists but in bad format
- Conception-data: About concepts and wether they exist in languages, format unusual
- CDS: Non-binary cognate data spread over files, cognate-classes seem missing
- DEV: Data seems to be data/phoible.csv, multistate matrix, but taxa are sounds of a language, no idea how to make an alignment
- Dictionaraia: cldf/entries.csv lists word in languages, not idea how to put into an alignment
- Glottolog: Metadata about languages, alignment makes no sense
- IDS: Cognate data, but cognates.csv i.e. Cognate Classes Missing
- Tsammalex: names.csv and categories.csv exist, but for binarization, additional information required
- For the other entries in CLLD I could not even find any data for download

- Autotyp: values.csv exists but in bad format
- Carling_MS: Seems to contain same information as DiACL, however binarization unclear
- Carling_Lexical: pone.0223588.s002 contains non-binary cognate data, however cognate classes seem to be missing
- Carling_Gender: Unstructured Appendix pdf, no idea
- pnas: pairwise matching between languages, binarization unclear


Unused binary alignments:
- Unusually huge alignment: (cldf_huge)
    (num_taxa: usually < 100, everything > 200 absolute outlier)
    (num_sites: ususally < 1200, alles > 5000 absolute outlier)
    - wals: 2660 x 1139, a lot of double sequences
    - abvd: 1571 x 18543
    - acd: 1058 x 85218
- Aligments with less than 4 taxa: (cldf_tiny)
    - clarkkimmun
    - lundgrenomagoa
- Other reasons
    - science_indoeuropean (is a subset of science with renamed taxa, corresponding to wals_indoeuropean)

Datasets not converted to multi-value alignments:
- Information must be provided, to infer which binary sites belong to the same characteristic
    Thus it is not possible for the datasets with binary alignments from phlorest and for the alignment from science
    Also not possible for sound class alignments from Jäger
- gaotb: Must be from a former version of lexibank, I got the binary from Jäger, but cannot compute the multi-value
- For DiACL and Mouton Atlas it could be possible, but requires coding and not sure about thresholds with information loss
- Those with too much information loss during conversion (see thesis)
    - For OSF: h=0.1, g=0.1
    - For CLDF: h=0, g=0.1

Unused multi-value alignments:
- Those with one state: (Not informative)
    - hsiuhmongmien
    - meloniromance
    - zhoubizic
    - allenbai
    - ratcliffearabic
- Those with two states: (Already binary, problems with iqtree)
    - chacontukanoan
    - simsrma
    - zhangrgyalrong
    - carvalhopurus
- Unusually huge alignments: (see above)
    - wals
    - acd
- Aligments with less than 4 taxa:
    - clarkkimmun

Comments on Lexibank-Extract from Jäger (Lexibank MrBayes)
- Not in Lexibank anymore: (This is the only one I am still using from Jäger)
    - gaotb
- Updated in Lexibank: (means we have a different version than Jäger):
    - abvdoceanic
    - walworthpolynesian
    - liusinitic
    - utoaztecan
(All the other ones seem to be identical according to the checks I did. I use my version, not Jägers)
