Final LogLikelihood: -969.916866

AIC score: 2121.833732 / AICc score: 18865.833732 / BIC score: 2338.598155
Free parameters (model + branch lengths): 91

WARNING: Number of free parameters (K=91) is larger than alignment size (n=80).
         This might lead to overfitting and compromise tree inference results!


WARNING: Best ML tree contains 8 near-zero branches!
