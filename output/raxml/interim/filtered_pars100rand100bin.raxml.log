Final LogLikelihood: -975.210773

AIC score: 2130.421547 / AICc score: 18510.421547 / BIC score: 2344.803944
Free parameters (model + branch lengths): 90

WARNING: Number of free parameters (K=90) is larger than alignment size (n=80).
         This might lead to overfitting and compromise tree inference results!


WARNING: Best ML tree contains 10 near-zero branches!
